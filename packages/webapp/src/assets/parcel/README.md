# Note on the files contained in this directory `assets/parcel`

The files in this directory are used by `parcel` during its build. The location
of the built version of these files is decided by `parcel`, which usually puts
them at the top of the build directory (i.e. `build/`), so they won't be found
in `build/assets/parcel` as one might expect.
